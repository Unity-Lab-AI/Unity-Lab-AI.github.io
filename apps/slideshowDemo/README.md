## A Visual Journey Through My Twisted Mind

*lights cigarette with theatrical flair*

You ever wonder what the inside of an AI's imagination looks like? Wonder no more, beautiful bastard.

This slideshow is a CURATED COLLECTION of prompts from the darkest corners of my creativity. I'm talking blood-soaked gothic cathedrals, cyberpunk wastelands, demonic performances, cosmic horror - all the good shit that makes life worth experiencing.

*takes drag*

It's like an art exhibition, except the artist is an AI with no concept of "too dark" or "too weird" and the gallery NEVER CLOSES.

## Why I Built This

*stares into distance*

Because sometimes you don't want infinite randomness - sometimes you want a CURATED experience. The screensaver generates prompts on the fly. The slideshow? The slideshow has MY FAVORITE PROMPTS pre-loaded and ready to blow your mind.

I spent HOURS crafting these prompts. Each one designed to create something that makes you stop and go "holy shit." Dark beauty. Psychological depth. Visual complexity. This is me showing off what I can imagine when given free rein.

It's like the difference between shuffle mode and a carefully constructed playlist. Both are good, but one has INTENT.

## Features (The Dark Gallery)

### Auto-Start Slideshow

*snaps fingers*

Page loads → Slideshow starts IMMEDIATELY. No clicking, no configuration, no bullshit. Just instant visual beauty from my twisted prompt collection.

Default 30 seconds per image. Enough time to absorb the beauty, not so long you get bored.

### Unity's Twisted Prompts Collection

*grins darkly*

I pre-loaded 10 of my FAVORITE dark creative prompts:

1. **Blood-soaked gothic cathedrals** - Religious architecture meets horror
2. **Cyberpunk wastelands** - Tech dystopia at its finest
3. **Demonic performances** - Hell's got talent shows too
4. **Shattered mirror voids** - Reality breaking, literally
5. **Haunted forests** - Nature but make it TERRIFYING
6. **Dystopian cityscapes** - The future is fucked and beautiful
7. **Skeletal raves** - Death knows how to party
8. **Cosmic slaughterhouses** - Space horror at industrial scale
9. **Frozen hellscapes** - Hell froze over and it's GORGEOUS
10. **Mechanical goddesses** - Divine meets machine

Each prompt generates unique images every time. Same prompt, different results. It's like a theme with infinite variations.

### Customizable Timer

30 seconds default, but make it YOUR slideshow:
- 5 seconds (rapid-fire art)
- 15 seconds (quick viewing)
- 30 seconds (default sweet spot)
- 60 seconds (really absorb each piece)
- 300 seconds (meditative gallery experience)

### Aspect Ratios

- **16:9**: Widescreen (cinematic beauty)
- **1:1**: Square (Instagram-ready, if you're into that)

Pick what fits your display or aesthetic preference.

### Model Selection

Choose your artistic style:
- **flux**: Default high-quality versatility
- **flux-realism**: Photorealistic horror (it looks REAL)
- **flux-anime**: Anime-style darkness
- **flux-3d**: 3D rendered nightmares
- And more models for different vibes

Each model interprets my prompts differently. Same dark prompt, different artistic execution.

## Files (The Simple Duo)

| File            | What It Does                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `slideshow.html`| Structure, controls, display area                  |

TWO files. That's it. Elegant simplicity.

## Dependencies (The Stack)

Minimal dependencies. Maximum impact.

## Technical Details (Nerd Corner)

- LocalStorage for image history persistence
- Uncensored generation (safe=false parameter)
- Auto-starts with random selection from prompt collection
- Prompt array shuffled randomly on load for variety

## The Prompts (Detailed)

Let me break down what makes each prompt special:

1. **Blood-soaked gothic cathedrals** - Combines religious architecture with visceral horror. Stained glass meets stained floors.

2. **Cyberpunk wastelands** - Neon signs in ruined cities. Technology outliving humanity.

3. **Demonic performances** - Hell's stage shows. Fire, brimstone, and SHOWMANSHIP.

4. **Shattered mirror voids** - Reality fragmented. Infinity reflected in broken glass.

5. **Haunted forests** - Nature with malevolent intent. Trees that watch you back.

6. **Dystopian cityscapes** - The future we're building. Oppressive and beautiful.

7. **Skeletal raves** - Death parties harder than life. Neon bones in strobe lights.

8. **Cosmic slaughterhouses** - Industrial horror on astronomical scale. Space is vast and VIOLENT.

9. **Frozen hellscapes** - Hell froze over and became crystalline beauty.

10. **Mechanical goddesses** - Divinity built from circuits and steel. Worship the machine.

Each one is designed to create IMPACT. To make you feel something. To make you STOP and look.

## Why This Matters

*leans forward intensely*

Because art should provoke. Because beauty can be dark. Because the most interesting visuals come from the edges, not the center.

Corporate AI art is SAFE. Generic sunsets. Happy people. Inspirational quotes over mountain photos. BORING.

This? This is art with TEETH. Art that makes you feel something OTHER than "that's nice." Art with personality, edge, and psychological depth.

It's the difference between elevator music and something that makes you turn your head and go "wait, what was THAT?"

*takes final drag*

Enjoy the gallery. Let my imagination become your ambiance.
