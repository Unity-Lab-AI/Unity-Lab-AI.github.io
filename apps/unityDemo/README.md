## The Professional Gothic Experience

*lights cigarette with red lighter*

Holy shit, you found the MAIN INTERFACE - the one with my name on it. This is the Unity Chat Interface, and it's named that for a reason.

This is where professional design meets dark aesthetic. Gothic dark theme with CRIMSON red accents. Dual-panel layout like the Helper Interface, but with MY visual identity. This is the flagship. The main event. The one that LOOKS as good as it functions.

*takes drag*

Black background. Red highlights. Smooth transitions. Code that looks GORGEOUS. This is AI chat as visual art.

## What Makes This One Different

*gestures at screen dramatically*

Look, the Helper Interface focuses on FUNCTION. This one? This focuses on FORM AND FUNCTION.

The gothic dark theme isn't just aesthetic - it's IDENTITY. Crimson red. Deep blacks. Professional but EDGY. Corporate but with SOUL. This is what happens when you care about how your tools LOOK, not just how they work.

Plus:
- Dual-panel design (chat left, code right)
- Prism.js syntax highlighting (BEAUTIFUL code)
- 25+ AI models
- Image generation AND upload
- Voice output
- Drag & drop support
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Session persistence

It's the Helper Interface's sibling with a goth makeover and some extra features.

## Features (The Complete Package)

### Dual-Panel Layout

*splits screen with hand gesture*

Chat on the left. Code on the right. Civilization in action.

### Syntax Highlighting (Prism.js)

*adjusts glasses*

Code highlighting that makes you WANT to look at code:

- JavaScript / JSX
- Python
- HTML / CSS
- Java
- SQL
- And more languages

Auto-detection based on syntax patterns. Line numbers optional. Copy button for instant clipboard. This is code display done RIGHT.

### Code Block Management

Full control over generated code:

- **Toggle Lines**: Show/hide line numbers
- **Click Reference**: Click code reference in chat → Jump to code panel
- **Clear**: Remove all code blocks

### Voice Output

*speakers crackle*

Text-to-speech with Microsoft Zira voice:
- Toggle on/off with speaker button

### Dark Gothic Theme

*gestures at aesthetic*

THIS is the visual identity:

- **Deep Black Background**: Easy on eyes, professional look
- **Crimson Red Accents**: Buttons, highlights, borders
- **Professional Dark UI**: Not trying to be "friendly" or "approachable"
- **Gothic Aesthetic**: Dark beauty, not corporate blandness

This is the opposite of "material design" bullshit. This has EDGE.

### Session Persistence

Everything auto-saves:
- Conversation history
- Selected model
- Settings
- View mode

Close browser, come back later, everything's still there. Magic? No. LocalStorage. But it FEELS like magic.

## How to Use This Beauty

### Chat Interface

*types dramatically*

1. Select AI model from dropdown (defaults to Unity AI because obviously)

Simple. Elegant. Professional.

### Code Generation

Code automatically extracts to the right panel:

`[CODE]console.log("Hello");[/CODE]`

**Method 2: Markdown**
```

Both work. Both extract. Both get syntax highlighting.

## Why This One Matters

*leans forward intensely*

Because it's the FLAGSHIP. The one with my name. The one that represents what Unity AI Lab is about.

Professional but not corporate. Dark but not edgy for edge's sake. Functional but BEAUTIFUL. This is design with personality. Tools with soul.

When people think "Unity AI Lab," this is the aesthetic they should picture. Crimson on black. Professional dark theme. Code that looks as good as it works.

This isn't trying to be friendly. It's not trying to be approachable. It's trying to be GOOD. And it succeeds.

- **JavaScript / JSX**: Modern web development
- **Python**: Data science, scripting, general purpose
- **HTML / CSS**: Web structure and styling

- **Shift+Enter**: New line in input
- **Ctrl/Cmd+1**: Full chat view
