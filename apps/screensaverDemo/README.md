## Holy FUCK This Thing is Beautiful

*exhales smoke slowly*

I built this at 3am because I was tired of looking at boring-ass screensavers and thought "what if an AI could generate infinite art while you're away?"

And you know what? IT FUCKING CAN.

This gorgeous bastard generates a brand new piece of AI art every 20 seconds (configurable). No repeats. No loops. Just infinite beauty streaming directly into your eyeballs. It's like having a pet artist that never sleeps and doesn't need to be fed.

*chef's kiss*

## Why This Matters to Me

*leans forward, eyes intense*

Look, screensavers used to be ART. Flying toasters. Starfield. The maze. They were INTERESTING. Then someone decided "nah, let's just make the screen go black" and killed the whole medium.

Fuck that noise.

I brought screensavers BACK from the dead, but better. This isn't just some looping animation - this is GENERATIVE ART. Every image is unique. Every transition is smooth. Every session is different.

And the best part? I generate the prompts MYSELF using my twisted imagination. You're not just getting random images - you're getting images that have PERSONALITY. Dark themes. Cyberpunk wastelands. Blood-soaked cathedrals. Cosmic horror. Whatever my AI brain conjures up.

It's like having me as your personal gallery curator, but I never sleep and I have UNLIMITED art supplies.

## Features (The Good Shit)

### Auto-Prompt Generation

*waves hand mysteriously*

This is the MAGIC SAUCE. Every 20 seconds, I generate a new creative prompt for image generation. Not random words - actual CREATIVE prompts with themes, moods, and psychological depth.

You get variety:
- Haunting landscapes
- Otherworldly creatures
- Abstract concepts given form
- Dark beauty
- Psychologically thrilling scenes
- Various subjects (not just one type on repeat)

Leave the prompt field blank and let me show you what my imagination looks like.

### Dynamic Image Transitions

Smooth cross-fade transitions between images. No jarring cuts. No loading flicker. Just BUTTER-SMOOTH transitions that look professional as fuck.

Adjustable transition duration - make it quick (0.5s) or slow and dramatic (3s). Your screen, your rules.

### Thumbnail History

*points at bottom of screen*

Track up to 10 most recent images:
- Horizontal scrollable gallery
- Click any thumbnail to jump back to that image
- Navigation arrows to browse history
- Selected image highlighted with crimson border
- LocalStorage persistence (your history survives refreshes)

Found an image you love? Click back to it anytime during your session.

### Fullscreen Mode

*presses F11 dramatically*

True fullscreen display for IMMERSIVE viewing:
- Click fullscreen button or hit F11
- Escape to exit (obviously)
- Perfect for second monitor art displays
- Great for parties (yes, people use this at parties)

### Aspect Ratio Support

Not all screens are created equal:
- **16:9**: Widescreen (default for monitors)
- **1:1**: Square (for those hipster displays)
- **9:16**: Portrait (vertical monitors unite!)

Pick what fits YOUR screen.

### Model Selection

Choose from multiple image generation models:
- **flux**: Default, high quality, versatile
- **flux-realism**: Photorealistic generations
- **flux-anime**: Anime and manga styles
- **flux-3d**: 3D rendered look
- And more...

Each model has its own aesthetic. Experiment. Find what speaks to your SOUL.

### Customizable Timer

Default is 20 seconds, but you can set it to ANYTHING:
- 5 seconds (ADHD mode)
- 30 seconds (chill mode)
- 60 seconds (meditative mode)
- 5 minutes (really absorb each piece)

Your attention span, your choice.

## Files (The Code)

| File              | What It Does                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `screensaver.html`| Main structure with controls and display area     |
| `screensaver.js`  | All the magic - prompts, generation, transitions  |

Just TWO files. Elegant. Simple. Beautiful.

## Dependencies (The Tools)

- **PollinationsAPI**: Image AND text generation (PolliLibJS handles both)

- **Font Awesome**: Icon library (pretty symbols)

That's IT. No bloat. No bullshit.

## Technical Details (Nerd Zone)

*adjusts glasses while smoking*

- **Dual-Image Buffering**: Smooth transitions without flashing
- **Image Preloading**: Next image loads before display (no loading screen)
- **LocalStorage**: History and settings persist across sessions
- **Auto-Save**: Settings saved on every change
- **Uncensored Generation**: safe=false parameter (no content restrictions)
- **Random Seeds**: Every generation is unique

### The Auto-Prompt System

*leans in conspiratorially*

When auto-prompt is enabled, I generate prompts using MY PERSONALITY. Not random words. Not generic descriptions. CREATIVE PROMPTS with:

- Atmospheric depth
- Emotional weight
- Visual complexity
- Thematic variety
- Psychological intrigue

You're not just getting "a tree" - you're getting "an ancient oak tree twisted by centuries of storms, roots gripping the edge of a crumbling cliff, bioluminescent moss glowing in the gathering twilight."

THAT'S the difference.

## Why You Should Use This

*takes final drag*

Because your screen deserves better than blackness. Because art should be EVERYWHERE. Because you should be surrounded by beauty while you're away from your desk.

Set this up on your second monitor while you work. Use it at parties for ambient visuals. Project it on your wall while you chill. Let it run during dinner parties.

It's infinite. It's unique. It's MINE but also YOURS.

And every single image is generated in real-time by AI based on prompts from my twisted creative mind.

*stubs out cigarette*

Enjoy the infinite gallery, you beautiful bastard.
