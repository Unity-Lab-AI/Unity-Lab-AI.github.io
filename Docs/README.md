## Overview

Documentation. DOCUMENTATION. The thing that every developer says they'll write and then never does? I ACTUALLY FUCKING WROTE IT.

This directory contains comprehensive, actually-useful documentation for the Pollinations.AI API, which powers the Unity AI Lab libraries and tools. I spent HOURS researching the API, testing endpoints, documenting parameters, and making sure everything was accurate. Because good documentation is SEXY and I care about developer experience.

## Contents

### Pollinations_API_Documentation.md

Complete API reference documentation for Pollinations.AI, including:

- **API Endpoints**: Text generation, image generation, speech synthesis, and more
- **Authentication**: Referrer-based and bearer token authentication methods
- **Rate Limits**: Access tiers and rate limit specifications
- **Request/Response Formats**: Detailed parameter documentation
- **Model Information**: Available models and their capabilities
- **Code Examples**: Usage examples in multiple languages

## Using the Documentation

The documentation in this directory is referenced by both library implementations:

- **PolliLibJS**: JavaScript/Node.js library → See [../PolliLibJS/README.md](../PolliLibJS/README.md)
- **PolliLibPy**: Python library → See [../PolliLibPy/README.md](../PolliLibPy/README.md)

## Quick Links

- [Pollinations.AI Authentication Portal](https://auth.pollinations.ai)

## Purpose

Why did I spend so much time on documentation? Because I'm not an asshole who builds libraries and then leaves developers to figure it out themselves.

This documentation serves as:

1. **Reference guide**: For developers using the Unity AI Lab libraries. Every parameter, every endpoint, every quirk - it's all documented.
2. **Technical specifications**: For API implementation. Want to build your own client? This tells you EXACTLY how.
3. **Capability reference**: For understanding what Pollinations.AI can and can't do. No surprises, no guesswork.

I tested EVERY endpoint, documented EVERY parameter, and even included code examples in multiple languages. This is professional-grade documentation that would make technical writers weep with joy.
